# jwtgen

Command line tool that generates JWT tokens that helps in the testing of applications.

## Features
* Signatures for HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-SHA384, HMAC-SHA512 and RSA-SHA256
* Issued at (iat) and expiry (exp) values can be configured as offsets
* Claims can be encoded as JSON or as separate arguments

## Installation

Install via npm.

	npm install -g jwtgen

## Getting Started

The following command will generate a JWT using HMAC-SHA256, a shared secret of `my-secret`, expires in 1 hour and contains user id of `user123` as the `iss` value.

```
jwtgen -a HS256 -s "my-secret" -c "iss=user123" -e 3600

```

If the same command is run with the `-v` option, a more verbose output is displayed.

```
jwtgen -a HS256 -s "my-secret" -c "iss=user123" -e 3600 -v

algorithm: HS256

claims:
{
  "iss": "user1234",
  "iat": 1457555405,
  "exp": 1457559005
}

token:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJ1c2VyMTIzNCIsImlhdCI6MTQ

```

## Expired Tokens

Expired tokens can be generated by specifying an offset to the `iat` value. The following example issues the token 1 hour (3600 seconds) in the past and expires at the generated time.

```
jwtgen -a HS256 -s "my-secret" -c "iss=user1234" -i=-3600  -e 3600 -v
algorithm: HS256

claims:
{
  "iss": "user1234",
  "iat": 1457552128,
  "exp": 1457555728
}

token:
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJ1c2VyMTIzNCIsImlhdCI6MTQ

```

## Tokens Not Valid Yet

Tokens that are not yet valid can be generated by specifying the `iat` value directly as in the following example:

```
jwtgen -a HS256 -s "my-secret" -c "iss=user1234" -i=1557555728  -e 3600 -v
algorithm: HS256

claims:
{
  "iss": "user1234",
  "iat": 1557555728,
  "exp": 1557559328
}

token:
